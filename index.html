    <p>For every generation there is a great man who is raised to uplift his people.
    However, everyone has a chance to build something extra ordinary to show himself worth of attention.</p>

  <p>You choose what would keep you afloat and run with it.
    Be what you are destined to be, GREAT!!

  <p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
― Frank Herbert, Dune</p>
